Hello,

The name of this demonstration is Blogged!, it is an incredibly simple blog system.

Dev time totals approximately 13hrs (6-7hrs were spent installing and learning Laravel, 
the additional ~7hrs was spent on actual development).

I have not hardcoded any urls, so it should work well with anything you want (in terms of virtual hosting). 
For development I setup a virtualhost (http://www.blogged.com).

All web related files/folders are in the 'web' folder.
the database structure should be along side this readme. please be sure to update the .env config file to match your database settings.


Thank you for your patience, and if you have any issues getting it to work please let me know.
